Continue a partial download

If you're downloading a very large file, you might find that you have to interrupt the download. With the --continue (-c for short), wget can determine where the download left off and continue the file transfer. That means the next time you download a 4 GB Linux distribution ISO you don't ever have to go back to the start when something goes wrong.


wget -c
