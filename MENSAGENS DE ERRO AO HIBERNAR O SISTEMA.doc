#SCRIPT DE CONFIGURAÇÃO:
$sudo gedit /etc/default/grub


#TEXTO DO SCRIPT:

Here already answers are provided which also helped me a lot. I use text mode of ubuntu 16.04 and so

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash pci=nomsi"

didn't helped me. Here what I changed was -- (in /etc/default/grub)

GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`
#GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash pci=nomsi"
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="text pci=nomsi"

# Uncomment to enable BadRAM filtering, modify to suit your needs
# This works with Linux (no patch required) and with any kernel that obtains
# the memory map information from GRUB (GNU Mach, kernel of FreeBSD ...)
#GRUB_BADRAM="0x01234567,0xfefefefe,0x89abcdef,0xefefefef"

# Uncomment to disable graphical terminal (grub-pc only)
GRUB_TERMINAL=console

# The resolution used on graphical terminal
# note that you can use only modes which your graphic card supports via VBE
# you can see them in real GRUB with the command `vbeinfo'
#GRUB_GFXMODE=640x480

which solved my error(NOTE - I used only pci=nomsi, and in case it don't work other option is pci=noaer), that may help solve anyone facing the same error.
