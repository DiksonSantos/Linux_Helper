    wine-notepad creates a local mime association for text/plain and some other types in the file ~/.local/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache; this effectively allows it as an alternative to anything gedit (or your default GUI editor) would otherwise open
    To disable, open ~/.local/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache in a text editor and delete the lines with the MIME types text/plain and text/html
    Also move/delete wine-extension-txt.desktop and wine-extension-htm.desktop from ~/.local/share/applications/
    Most text or text-like files should default back to your GUI editor
