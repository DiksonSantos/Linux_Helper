Installation

Step 1: Install bash-completion

$ sudo apt-get install bash-completion

And some times it works if we re-installed it by the follwing command:

$ sudo apt-get install --reinstall bash-completion

Step 2: Enable bash-completion in your .bashrc file

Open your gedit ~/.bashrc and if these content doesn't exist there, add them at
 the end of it and save it.

# enable bash completion in interactive shells
if ! shopt -oq posix; then
  if [ -f /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion ]; then
    . /usr/share/bash-completion/bash_completion
  elif [ -f /etc/bash_completion ]; then
    . /etc/bash_completion
  fi
fi

___________________________

After changing the file you need to source your  ~/.bashrc with source ~/.bashrc or
 reopen your Terminal. It should be fixed now.
