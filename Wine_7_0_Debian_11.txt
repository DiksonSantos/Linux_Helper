Install Wine 7.X from WineHQ repository

With this method, you will be guaranteed the latest available version of Wine. But you will have to go through a series of steps to have wine installed on your Debian 11 system as below.

First, we need to add the WineHQ repositories to our Debian 11 system. Begin by importing the GPG keys as shown

sudo apt -y install gnupg2 software-properties-common
wget -nc https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key
sudo apt-key add winehq.key

The output should be “OK” to show that the keys have been added successfully. Now add the WineHQ repositories to your Debian 11 system.

sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/debian/ bullseye main'

The above command adds the WineHQ repository to /etc/apt/sources.list. Now update your APT package index.

sudo apt update

Now download the latest stable version of Wine on Debian 11 using the command:

sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-stable


$ wine --version
wine-7.0
