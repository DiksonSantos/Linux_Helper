Install Django on Debian 10
1) Install Python and PIP3 on Debian 10
Django is a Python framework so make sure it is installed. On the other hand, Django is easily installable if we use PIP. So, the first step is to install them both.

To do this, open a Terminal session and run the following:

:~$ sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
1.- Install Python and PIP on Debian 10
1.- Install Python and PIP on Debian 10
At the end of the installation, you can check the installed version of PIP with the following command:

:~$ pip3 -V
pip 18.1 from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/pip (python 3.7)
2) Install Django on Debian 10
Once PIP is installed, you can start installing Django. Itâ€™s really simple, just use the following command:

:~$ sudo pip3 install Django
2.- Install Django on Debian 10
2.- Install Django on Debian 10
Then, check the installed version.

:~$ django-admin --version
2.2.4
So, Django is ready to create a new project.

3) Create a new Django project
Now we can create new projects to start working with Django. To do this, we first choose a destination folder. In my case, I will choose /var/www/ as an example. Inside it, I will create a new project called example.

:~$ cd /var/www/
:~$ sudo django-admin startproject example
Next, navigate into the example folder and migrate to set the initial configuration.

:~$ cd example 
:~$ sudo python3 manage.py migrate

Also, you have to create the superuser to manage the project.

:~$ sudo python3 manage.py createsuperuser

4.- Creating the new superuser for Django on Debian 10
As you can see, it only requires a username, email, and password. If you do not type any username, it will take root as the superuser.

The next step is to edit the project configuration file to make it accessible from any computer. This is vital if you work remotely on a network computer.

So, open the following file using nano.

:~$ sudo nano example/settings.p
And edit the following entry:

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['COMPUTER_IP_WHICH_IS_RUNNING_DJANGO']
5.- Edit the configuration file
5.- Edit the configuration file
Next, serve the project:

:~$ sudo python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
6.- Running the project
6.- Running the project
